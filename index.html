            <h3>Being a Poop Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Musleh, an electronics enthusiast. I've had damaged so many electronic devices at home, which
                didn't make my family too happy. And the result was MAIR! But my love for electronics hasn't wavered. I've worked on different projects
                and even got second place in a competition. And oh yes! I'm also into photography, capturing amazing moments.
                Now, I'm excited to dive into web development, merging my electronics , artistic eye, and passion to create poop
                web experiences.</p>

            <h1>Never Stop Learning</h1>
            <h2>Stay Foolish</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">"Never stop learning, be a fool." This phrase emphasizes the importance of lifelong learning and the willingness to
            embrace a sense of foolishness. It suggests that true wisdom lies in recognizing that there is always more to discover
            and understand, and that being open to new experiences and knowledge requires a willingness to take risks and make
            mistakes. By maintaining a humble and curious mindset, we can continue to grow intellectually and personally. Being a
            "fool" in this context means being unafraid to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and venture into unfamiliar
            territory in the pursuit of knowledge and personal development.</p>
